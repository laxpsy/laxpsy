### 👋 Greetings 
I'm Ansh Gujral, a developer currently studying at NIT-Tiruchirappalli currently.
I work in Delta Force, our institutes's web cell. Here's a list of projects I have worked on/am currently working on as a part of Delta Force.

### 📌 Projects I've Worked On
- Festember'23 Mobile Application (Tech Stack: Native Android, Kotlin with XML for Layouts. We integrated with Payload CMS for the data for the application.)
- Pragyan'24 INHOTTS Website (Tech Stack: PHP)
- Pragyan'24 Arcadia Game (Tech Stack: TS, React, Phaser for the Front-End, GoLang for the Back-End. A SQL database and Redis for caching.)

### 🤝 My interests
Anything low-level generally interests me, and networks as well; Other than that, I'm always open to diving into new tech stacks and learning new stuff. Each project is an opportunity to learn more and grow as a developer :)
