### 👋 Greetings 
I'm Ansh Gujral, a developer currently studying at NIT-Tiruchirappalli currently. I work primarily on native Android apps currently, although I'm diving into Web-Development as well. 
I work in Delta Force, our institutes's web cell. Here's a list of projects I have worked on/am currently working on as a part of Delta Force.

### 📌 Projects I've Worked On
Festember'23 Mobile Application (Tech Stack Native Android, Kotlin with XML for Layouts. We integrated with Payload CMS for the data for the application.)

### 🤝 My interests
Anything low-level generally interests me, other than that I'm really getting into Web Development recently. Other than that, I'm always open to diving into new tech stacks and learning new stuff. Each project is an opportunity to learn more and grow as a developer :)

### 🧑‍🔧 I have decent amount of experience with
- Javascript
- Express.js
- Kotlin
- Jetpack Compose
